# Data-structure
# 1. Bag
# 2. Hash
# 3. Linked list
* I build the linked list using c++, python language
# 4. Queue
  * FIFO (First-in, first-out), or LILO (Last-in, Last-out)
  * Enqueue: Input the data to Queue
  * Dequeue: Output the data at Queue
  
  ### In python laguage
   * Queue(): Most basic data structure
   * LifoQueue(): Last input data is first output
   * PriorityQueue(): Each data has priority, the height priority data is first output
   
#5. Stack
  * Structure with limited access to data
     - Structure in which data can be inserted or removed only at one end
  * Data structure from which the last accumulated data can be pulled out first
     - Queue : FIFO policy
     - Stack : LIFO policy
  * Stack structure
     - The stack follows LIFO or FILO data management metods.
     - LIFO :Data management policy that extracts the last data first
     - FILO : Data management policy that extracts the data that was put first and last
     - Push() : push data onto the stack
     - pop() : pop data off the stack
